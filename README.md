# Chorus Lapilli

A modified (and much more fun!) version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe.

Play with AI or with a friend! (Warning: the AI is really good!)

The front end for the game can be found in the `chorus-lapilli` folder, while the `chorus-lapilli ai` folder contains the Python script used to train the AI.

The finished game is hosted [here](https://decycle.github.io/Chrous-Lapilli/).
